# Pentesting-Notes
Pentesting cheat sheet and supplemental scripts I'v used for HTB/THM and other pentesting exercises... Useful payload generation notes at bottom using MSFVenom, along with other helpful commands. 

Scan.sh script is referenced in Pentesting Notes
  Usage: chmod +x scan.sh; ./scan.sh
